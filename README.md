# Automation-of-industrial-process
This project explains an industrial process that involves picking and placing a material/product on a conveyor and a pusher pushing it to a box at a specified destination detected by a proximity sensor. The process continues to run automatically after the ready switch and start buttons are activated until the toggle switch is switched to stop. The logic is handled by a PLC (Mitsubishi FX series PLC). Thousands of materials/products can be placed in a day. This is a good application of industrial automation implementing a PLC, pick and place robot, pusher and a conveyor.
